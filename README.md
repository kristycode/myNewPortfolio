#myPortfolio

This is an updated version of my portfolio, featuring some new completed class activities and group projects.

#development

I chose to utilize the Bulma's css framework for this, however I would like to recreate this in Bootstrap. Although I do like some unique aesthetic elements that Bulma provides, I'm not quite sure why one of its "selling points" over other frameworks is the abscence of Javascript, however features like the hamburger menu does not work at all on its own and necessitiates use of JS to make functional (which I did not implement). I also found that it does not as effortlessly provide the means to create a "gallery" with thumbnails, and even implementation of the hero image was something I ended up finding a Japanese website to give me an easy purely html/css-based work-around.

Although I realize it is an uphill battle to protect some of my intimate personal info and maintain my preferred visibility online, I simply did not feel comfortable directly linking my detailed resume with direct contact information on this portfolio, so I intentionally chose not to include it.

#thoughts

Updating this portfolio really had me face that I am not satisfied by the work I've produced in my full stack development program so far, and wouldn't feel proud to necessarily share many of the things I've created-- and this is not fault of the program, but entirely my own; not because I find my development from the ground-up embarassing (progress is great!), but simply because I know I am capable of much more. Doing this portfolio again has re-ignited my motivation to go back and tidy up my previous github repos, complete and make whole a few not-entirely-functional prior activities, and reinvest in what I had hoped I would come out from this program proud to share with future employers. And also, I need to really just redo this portfolio in an entirely different framework.
